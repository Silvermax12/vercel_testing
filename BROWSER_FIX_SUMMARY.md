# Browser Session Management Fixes

## Problem Identified

The error `session not created: probably user data directory is already in use` was occurring due to:

1. **Race conditions** in browser instance creation
2. **Multiple browser instances** being created simultaneously
3. **Insufficient cleanup delays** between browser sessions
4. **Lack of synchronization** for browser creation

## Root Cause

Your backend architecture is actually **correct**:
- ✅ **Backend**: Scrapes and provides direct download URLs
- ✅ **Flutter**: Downloads directly to device storage using dio/flutter_downloader

The issue was **NOT** with the download process, but with the **browser session management** used for web scraping.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Thread-Safe Browser Creation
- Added a global `threading.Lock()` to ensure only one browser instance is created at a time
- Prevents concurrent browser creation that was causing conflicts

### 2. Improved Error Handling & Retries
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for browser creation
- Better error messages and logging
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

### 3. Enhanced Chrome Options
- Added additional Chrome flags to prevent background processes from interfering
- Improved isolation between browser instances

### 4. Better Cleanup Management
- Added delays before cleanup to ensure Chrome fully releases resources
- More robust directory cleanup with error handling

### 5. Configuration Management
- Centralized browser configuration in `config.py`
- Easily adjustable retry counts, delays, and timeouts

## Files Modified

- `browser.py` - Core browser management improvements
- `scraper.py` - Updated to use improved browser creation
- `session_mgr.py` - Updated to use improved browser creation
- `config.py` - Added browser configuration options
- `test_browser_fix.py` - Test script to verify fixes

## How It Works Now

1. **Sequential Processing**: Browser instances are created one at a time using a lock
2. **Unique Directories**: Each browser gets a completely isolated user data directory
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Resources are cleaned up with appropriate delays
4. **Retry Logic**: Failed browser creation attempts are retried automatically
5. **Error Isolation**: Issues with one browser instance don't affect others

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
python test_browser_fix.py
```

This will test both sequential and concurrent browser creation scenarios.

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more "user data directory already in use" errors
- ✅ More stable scraping operations
- ✅ Better resource management
- ✅ Improved error recovery

## Your Download Process Remains Unchanged

Your Flutter app will continue to work exactly as before:
1. Backend scrapes download URLs successfully
2. Flutter receives direct download URLs
3. Flutter downloads directly to device storage
4. No changes needed in your mobile app

The fixes only improve the **web scraping reliability** in your backend.
